                    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                    <p>100 (3.5 inch square) wonton wrappers</p>
                    <p>1 Â¾ pounds ground pork</p>
                    <p>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</p>
                    <p>4 cloves garlic, minced</p>
                    <p>2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion</p>
                    <p>4 tablespoons soy sauce</p>
                    <p>3 tablespoons sesame oil</p>
                    <p>1 egg, beaten</p>
                    <p>5 cups finely shredded Chinese cabbage</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <p>In a large bowl, combine the pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, soy sauce, sesame oil, egg and cabbage. Stir until well mixed.</p>
                    <p>Place 1 heaping teaspoon of pork filling onto each wonton skin. Moisten edges with water and fold edges over to form a triangle shape.</p>
                    <p>Roll edges slightly to seal in filling. Set dumplings aside on a lightly floured surface until ready to cook.</p>
                    <p>Arrange dumplings in a covered bamboo or metal steamer so they don't touch to prevent them from sticking together; steam for 15 minutes, or until pork is cooked through.</p>
                    <p>Serve hot and enjoy!</p>
